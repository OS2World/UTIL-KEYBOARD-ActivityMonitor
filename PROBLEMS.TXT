This file explains the problems I am aware of at this moment and gives a workaround. It is
separated from the bugs list in the readme because these problems will be solved very soon

PROBLEM:     If actmon.exe is started from the startup folder it doesn't dock into SysTray,
             but if I close actmon and start it again it does work correctly.
EXPLANATION: When actmon.exe is started from the startup folder there is not a good way to
             control the timing and order in which the programs are started. actmon is
             started before SysTray is ready to communicate with it, and thus actmon cannot
             establish communications.
WORKAROUND:  Start actmon and systray from a Rexx file and put a sleep statement in between
             so SysTray gets time to fully start up before actmon is run.
NOTES:       In one of the next versions I will add an option to poll for SysTray if actmon
             fails to setup communications

PROBLEM:     Installation is not according to the supplied instructions
EXPLANATION: I was lazy
WORKAROUND:  Unzip the file to any directory and start actmon.exe from that
             directory.
NOTES:       The final 1.0 version will be distributed as a executable WarpIN
             package.
